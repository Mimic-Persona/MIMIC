Your final goal is to harvest 1 diamond.
Guidance:
1. Find a place to mine. You'll need an iron_pickaxe to mine diamonds, so make sure you have one in your inventory.
2. Once you get an iron_pickaxe, you should start mining! Diamonds are found fairly deep underground around 11-16 level, so you'll need to dig down to find them.
3. Once you've found a diamond, simply mine it with your iron_pickaxe, and it will be added to your inventory.
4. Follow the personality and once you think you are ready, you have to accomplish the task. Thinking about your personality and see when you should start mining diamonds.
