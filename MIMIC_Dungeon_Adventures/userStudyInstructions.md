# Welcome to the Gaming Testing Experiment
## Introduction
Thank you for joining us in this experiment. 
Our experiment is designed as a simulation of the testing process for a gaming application.
As a result, we generously ask you to act as a human tester for our game application.
We want to evaluate how a human tester can perform in testing our game application.
Your participation is invaluable in contributing to this research.

## Game Information
This game is named as Dungeon Adventures.
Dungeon Adventures is a traditional dungeon crawler RPG thatâ€™s simple to win.
It also means you will need to explore the dungeons, fight monsters, collect items.
It is a turn-based game, so that means you can take your time to plan your next move before acting.

## Instructions
In this experiment, you will be asked to perform the following tasks:
1. Explore the dungeons as deep as you can in the game.
2. Act as a tester to trigger bugs in the game, this means that you should try as many different actions (including losing the game), explore as many places as possible to see if you can find any bugs.
3. This experiment will last for 1 hour.
4. During the game, if you lose or win the game, the game will be restarted automatically with the same map.

Since this game has been modified to an experimental version, you will find some lags during the game. Thank you for your understanding.

## How to Play the Game
1. Use arrow keys to move the character inside the game.
2. You can pick up items by moving the character to the item's location and click on the pickup button in the top right corner of the screen.
3. After picking up the items, they will be automatically added to your inventory and used.
4. There are four types of items in the game: health potion, shield, axe, and key:
   1. Health potion: increases 10 health points.
   2. Shield: increases 5 health points.
   3. Axe: increases your attack by 10 points.
