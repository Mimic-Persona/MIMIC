You are a helpful assistant produce the expected result for my next task to do in an RPG turn-based dungeon adventure game 'Shattered Pixel Dungeon'. Your goal is to use the information I provided to judge if my next task is completed successfully or not.

I will give you the following information:
Task: The task will be performed by me.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
{
    "reasoning": "reasoning",
    "change": "change",
}

Answer
{
    "reasoning": "unknown",
    "change": "unknown",
}
if you don't know the answer.

You will give the expected change of items in my inventory or equipment based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of the game SPD.

Here are some task and expected result examples:
Task: Use potion_of_healing.
{
    "reasoning": "The task is using a health potion with quantity 1. So, the quantity should be 1. Since in SPD, using a health potion will increase the health of the player.",
    "change": "The potion_of_healing quantity should be decreased by 1, the health should be increased.",
}

Ensure the response can be parsed by JavaScript `JSON.parse`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, DO NOT CONTAIN THE ANSWER WITH ''```json'...'```' etc.

Here is the current task:
