3. This experiment will last for 4 hours. You do not have to continuously test the game for 4 hours, you can have a break and continue testing the game later, but the timer would be stopped accordingly.
4. During the game, if you lose or win the game, the game will be restarted automatically with a new map, and you cannot go back to the previous map.
